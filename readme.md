A carefully curated collection of high-quality tools, libraries, research papers, projects, and tutorials centered around Model Context Protocol (MCP) â€” a novel paradigm designed to enable modular, adaptive coordination between large language models (LLMs) and external tools or data contexts. This repository serves as a comprehensive, well-organized knowledge hub for researchers and developers exploring the next frontier of interactive, context-aware AI systems.

The MCP framework facilitates fine-grained orchestration of model behavior through structured, tool-integrated communication protocols. It supports advanced workflows like adaptive reasoning, multi-tool routing, contextual memory access, and iterative refinement. By treating models not as static endpoints but as participants in a dynamic co-mining or co-creation loop, MCP pushes the boundaries of what intelligent systems can achieve.

To keep the community up-to-date with the latest developments, this repository is continuously enriched with newly published MCP-related papers, real-world use cases, and open-source implementations. From LangGraph-based architectures to custom tool routers and model-control interfaces, the collection aims to highlight both foundational ideas and emerging best practices.

Whether you are building AI agents, researching model-tool alignment, or experimenting with novel retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, this resource offers a centralized, evolving platform to explore the powerful and expanding universe of MCP-enabled systems.
